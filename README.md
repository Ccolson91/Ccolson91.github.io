## <a name="about"></a>About

I began my journey in tech after creating an automated marketing system for hair salons in my 20's. Little did I know the solution for my clients would become a lifelong passion that led me here.

Prior to software development, I have 13+ years experience working with small business owners to improve their sales and marketing strategies. I enjoy taking deep dives with clients to learn what they'd like to achieve and work together to uncover potential growth opportunities.
